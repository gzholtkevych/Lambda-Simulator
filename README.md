The **project aims** to develop a toolkit for forming practical skills in working with Lambda calculus
while studying the functional approach in Programming.

The project tasks are:

1. to develop a software simulator for providing
   1. representation of lambda terms as programming objects;
   2. standard transformations of lambda terms;
   3. estimating lambda terms' characteristics;
   4. library of different reduction strategies.
2. to compare the efficiency of different reduction strategies.
