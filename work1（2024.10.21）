Derive calculations based on Definition 1.24 regarding β-contracting and β-reducing in λ-calculus.
β-Contracting Example
Consider a λ-term: P=(λx.(x+1))3
Here,(λx.(x+1))is a λ-abstraction and 3 is an argument.

1、Identify the β-redex:
The term (λx.(x+1))3 is a β-redex.

2、Perform the contraction:
We replace the redex with its contractum[3/x](x+1), 
which means substituting x with 3: [3/x](x+1)=3+1

3、Resulting term:
The result of this contraction is:P′=3+1
We can denote this as P ▷1β P ′ 

β-Reducing Example
Next, let's see how to β-reduce P to another term Q.
Continuing from the previous result:
1、Evaluate the expression further:
From  P' = 3 + 1，we can compute:Q=4

2、From P′ to Q:
The expression 3 + 1 reduces directly to 4, which we can express as:P'→Q(normal evaluation)
This indicates that P can reduce to Q through a series of β-contractions and possibly other calculations.

Summary
Through this process, we started with the β-redex P, contracted it to P′ and subsequently ended up with Q. This illustrates how we use β-reduction to simplify terms in λ-calculus, capturing the essence of variable substitutions and function applications.
From these steps, you can observe the mechanism of reducing terms in λ-calculus:
P ▷1β P′  (one-step reduction)
P ▷β P′  (finite series reduction)
